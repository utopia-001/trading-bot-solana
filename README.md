# Solana Trading Bot

## Overview

The **Solana Trading Bot** is a Python-based tool for tracking token prices on the Solana blockchain, analyzing trends, and placing buy or sell orders based on a simple moving average (SMA) crossover strategy. It is designed for educational purposes and should be used responsibly.

### Features

- **Real-Time Price Fetching**: Retrieves token price data from a Solana DEX, such as Serum.
- **SMA Crossover Strategy**: Uses short-term and long-term SMAs to identify potential buy and sell signals.
- **Order Placement**: Places simulated buy and sell orders based on trading signals (real trading requires DEX integration).

### Prerequisites

To use this script, you’ll need:

1. **Python 3.x**
2. Required libraries: `requests`, `solana-py`
3. Solana wallet and API key for transaction management

Install the necessary libraries with:

```bash
pip install requests solana
```

### Usage

#### Step 1: Configure the API and Wallet Details

- **api_endpoint**: Set to the Solana RPC endpoint (e.g., `https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`).
- **wallet_keypair**: Load your Solana wallet keypair to sign and send transactions.
- **dex_market_id**: Specify the market ID of the token pair you want to trade (e.g., SOL/USDC).
  
#### Step 2: Run the Script

Run the script using:

```bash
py solana_trading_bot.py
```

The bot will monitor the specified token pair, calculate SMAs, and place orders when a buy or sell signal is detected.

### Example

To run the bot for the SOL/USDC pair on Serum with a Solana RPC endpoint, update the parameters:

```python
api_endpoint = "https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com"
wallet_keypair = "<YOUR_KEYPAIR_OBJECT>"
dex_market_id = "SERUM_MARKET_ID"
base_asset = "SOL"
quote_asset = "USDC"
```

Then execute:

```bash
py solana_trading_bot.py
```

### Important Notes

- **Test on Devnet**: Run the bot on Solana’s Devnet for testing to avoid potential losses.
- **Fees and Slippage**: Be aware of transaction fees and slippage that may impact trading performance.
- **Real Trading Caution**: This script includes a placeholder for order placement. Implement real DEX integration carefully and test thoroughly.

### Limitations

- **No Advanced Indicators**: This script uses only SMA for trading signals. More indicators can be added for improved performance.
- **Basic Order Execution**: Real DEX integration for order placement is required for actual trading.
- **Transaction Delay**: Monitor latency when placing orders, as network congestion may impact execution speed.

### Future Enhancements

- **More Trading Indicators**: Add indicators such as RSI or Bollinger Bands for a more sophisticated strategy.
- **Advanced Order Management**: Implement features like stop-loss, take-profit, and limit orders.
- **Backtesting Capabilities**: Integrate backtesting functionality for historical performance evaluation.
